The dataset for this project is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database . This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
This dataset is compromised of 768 observations of medical details for Pima Indian Patients. Each record has a class value that indicates whether the patient suffered an onset diabetes within 5 years (‘1’ if yes else ‘0’). 
Now, what I have done is I have used Naive Bayes Classification to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes and Gaussian Probability Density Function for prediction. Then, I have compared my accuracy against sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB’s accuracy.
